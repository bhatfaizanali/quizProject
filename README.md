# Quiz Management System (MVP)

This repository contains an MVP for a Quiz Management System (backend + minimal frontend scaffold).

Structure

- `server/` – Node.js + Express backend with Mongoose models and API routes.
- `client/` – Minimal React app scaffold to fetch quizzes from the API.
- `PLAN.md` – Project plan and goals.

Next steps

1. Install server dependencies and run the server.
2. Connect to a MongoDB instance (set `MONGO_URI` in `.env`).
3. Implement admin UI and polish client.
